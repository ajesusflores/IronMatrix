# IronMatrix
Linear algebra for C#

[Under Development]

Roadmap:

- Matrix and Vector support:
-- Scale Vector
-- Scale Matrix
-- Vector Addition
-- Matrix Addition
-- Vector Substraction
-- Scaled Vector Addition
-- Dot product 
--- Implement Slicing to improve performance
-- Vector Length [norm=2 (Euclidean), norm=1 (Manhattan), norm=n]
--- Implement Slicing to improve performance
--- Avoid possible Overflow for big numbers
-- Calculate Orthogonal Vector
-- Matrix and Vector multiplication
-- Generate Matrices
--- Zeroes Matrix
--- Identity Matrix
-- Transpose Matrix
